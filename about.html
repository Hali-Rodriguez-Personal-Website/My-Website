            I play 4 instruments! The bass, guitar, ukulele and piano. All are self taught with the exception of a few piano lessons. I first started with a ukulele I had been gifted on christmas. My dad said, “you're never gonna play, it’s just going to collect dust”. So out of spite I taught myself ukulele! From there I picked up the guitar, then piano and most recently the bass which is one of the instruments I wanted to learn the most!

            Growing up I was always surrounded by video games on consoles like the xbox where I played the popular game series 'Halo' with my cousins. As I grew older I got into more Rpg maker and Open world games. My interest in games and art let me into wanting to work in game development which is one of my greatest aspirations today!
