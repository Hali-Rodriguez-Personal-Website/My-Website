        <h2>ART</h2>
        <p class="about">
            I've always drawn art since I was a young kid. I would sketch on homework and notes, and occasionally paint.
            Once I reached Junior year of high school I had the opportunity to take a 3D animation class through a
            regional occupational center. There I learned how to animate using Autodesk Maya as well as other skills
            through photoshop! I took the class again for my senior year but unfortunately lost many opportunities due
            to covid. To turn my outlook around I took individual classes during quarantine for Zbrush, Photoshop and
            Maya to get a better grip on the softwares. Zbrush, a 3D sculpting software, turned out to be a software
            I’ve grown quite fond of and the one I have been working with the most these past few years. Today it is a
            hobby and skill that I hope I can utilize in a professional setting.

        <p class="about">
            I play 4 instruments! The bass, guitar, ukulele and piano. All are self taught with the exception of a few
            piano lessons. I first started with a ukulele I had been gifted on christmas. My dad said, “you're never
            gonna play, it’s just going to collect dust”. So out of spite I taught myself ukulele! From there I picked
            up the guitar, then piano and most recently the bass which is one of the instruments I wanted to learn the
            most!

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p class="about">
            Growing up I was always surrounded by video games on consoles like the xbox where I played the popular game
            series 'Halo' with my cousins. As I grew older I got into more Rpg maker and Open world games. My interest
            in games and art let me into wanting to work in game development which is one of my greatest aspirations
            today!
